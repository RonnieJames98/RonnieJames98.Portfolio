        <div id="iconDescript"><h1>Hello World</h1>
            <p>My name is Ronnie James Espinosa and I am an aspiring Front End Developer</p>
            <p>I have built this website as a portfolio holding all current and previous projects that I have worked on.</p>
            
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a graduate from California State University San Bernardino with B.A in Computer Systems.</p>
            <p>Computer Systems is a degree where you are expected to apply Computer Science in a business sense.</p>
            <p>As such, I have important business skills such as communication along with fundamental coding skills.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="Block">
            <h2>Coding Skills</h2>
            <p>I am knowledgable in using Python, Java, Javascript, C#, C++, and finally HTML/CSS.</p>
            <p>I have extensive experience in using Python, Java, and C# as I have done previous work as a Coding Instructor.</p>
            <p>My C# knowledge also extends to the software Unity, used for developing applications and video games.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="Block">
            <h2>Extra Skills</h2>
            <p>I have experience with UI/UX (User Interface/User Experience)</p>
            <p>In college I have had the opportunity to be apart of an Art Class that offered UI/UX.</p>
            <p>I found it very interesting in how a good design should flow naturally for the user.</p>
            <p>Following up from this class, I took an elective for Game Development and I graciously did some work on the UI team.</p>
            <p>I designed the Health Bar system and Unit Selection bar in Unity.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am also knowledgable in using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
            <p>Video Editing has been somewhat of a passion of mine and I have spent many hours honing my craft.</p>
            <p>Eventually I got interested in using Adobe Photoshop as well and I developed the skill alongside Premiere Pro.</p>
